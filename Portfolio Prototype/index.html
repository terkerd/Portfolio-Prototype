                        Hello, my name is Terrence Erkerd. I’m an upcoming web developer that loves to be creative and never afraid of going outside my comfort zone. In the beginning I didn’t know I wanted to be a web developer. 
                        I was going to school to become a network administrator. I got a intern position as a network administrator and realized, it wasn’t for me. It took me a few weeks to figure out what I wanted to go to school for. 
                        I remember my wife wanted her own website to sell her books and t-shirts and I told her I started creating my own website years ago but never did anything with it. So, I told her I will work on hers and see if I still got that “creative juice”. 
                        When I was creating her website, I realized how much I enjoyed working on it. I told myself, I still got it! So that is what got me on the web development career path. I have already created three websites for three different business owners and their users love using the sites. 
                        I really look forward to learning new techniques to improve my developing skills. By taking some classes at Wake Tech, I really feel my skills and understanding of web developing has improved. Learning about HTML, 
                        CSS and PhP has really gave me the upper hand so I can give a high level of support my customers and the knowledge to get a full time job as a web developer, until I build my business where I want it to be.
